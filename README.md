# SDCC - free open source, retargettable, optimizing ANSI-C compiler

Welcome to SDCC, free open source, retargettable, optimizing ANSI C
compiler suite that targets a growing list of processors including

* Intel MCS-51 based microprocessors (8031, 8032, 8051, 8052, etc.)
* Maxim (formerly Dallas) DS80C390 variants
* Freescale (formerly Motorola) HC08 based (hc08, s08)
* Zilog Z80 based MCUs (Z80, Z180, Game Boy, Rabbit 2000/3000, Rabbit 3000A, TLCS-90)
* STMicroelectronics STM8

Work is in progress on supporting the Microchip PIC16 and PIC18 targets.
It can be retargeted for other microprocessors.

See share/sdcc/doc/INSTALL.txt for the installation instructions for
the binary kits.

See the share/sdcc/doc directory for more documentation.

See <http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/> for the latest information on sdcc.


## Licenses

SDCC compiler suite is a collection of several components derived from
different sources with different FOSS licenses. See the sdccman.pdf
document, chapter "SDCC Suite Licenses" for details.

The code or object files generated by SDCC suite are not licensed, so
they can be used in FLOSS or proprietary (closed source) applications.

The great majority of sdcc run-time libraries are licensed under the
GPLv2+LE which allows linking of sdcc run time libraries with
proprietary (closed source) applications.

Exception are pic device libraries and header files which are derived
from Microchip header (.inc) and linker script (.lkr) files. Microchip
requires that "The header files should state that they are only to be
used with authentic Microchip devices" which makes them incompatible
with the GPL. Pic device libraries and header files are located at
non-free/lib and non-free/include directories respectively. Sdcc should
be run with the --use-non-free command line option in order to include
non-free header files and libraries.

## Support

SDCC compiler suite is a collaborative effort between a group of
volunteers. Please feel free to report bugs via the Sourceforge bug
tracker, or to ask questions on the user mailing list. See:

 <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=100599&group_id=599&func=browse>

 <http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=599>

Notes:
* The ds400, pic14 and pic16 are currently experimental, but work is in
progress. Please check <http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/snap.php> for snapshots.
* The TININative, avr and xa51 targets are no longer maintained.
